# Human Pose Estimation Project

## Overview
This project focuses on human pose estimation using computer vision techniques. It leverages OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect and analyze different parts of the human body, including the face, hands, and full body. The primary goal is to develop accurate and efficient pose estimation models applicable in various fields such as healthcare, sports, and entertainment.

## Features
- **Face Detection**: Identifies and tracks facial landmarks.
- **Hands Detection**: Detects and tracks hand landmarks.
- **Full Body Detection**: Analyzes and tracks the entire body pose.
- **Holistic Detection**: Combines face, hands, and full body detection for comprehensive pose analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **OpenCV**: An open-source computer vision and machine learning software library.
- **MediaPipe**: A framework for building multimodal machine learning pipelines.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/human-pose-estimation.git
